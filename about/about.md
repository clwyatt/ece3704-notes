title: "About the Notes"
---

This is a set of supplementary notes and examples for ECE 3704. It is not a replacement for the textbook, but can act as a reference and guide your reading. These notes are not comprehensive -- often additional material and insights are covered during class.

This material is well covered in the official course text "Oppenheim, A. V., Willsky, A. S., and Nawab, S. H. Signals and Systems\. ii, Essex UK: Prentice Hall Pearson, 1996." \cite{OW} (abbreviated OW). This is an older, but very good book. However there are many, many texts that cover the same material. \textit{Engaged} reading a textbook is one of the most important things you can do to learn this material. Again, these notes should **not** be considered a replacement for a textbook.
